                    <h1>The Illustrated Collection Vol 1</h1>
                </div>
                <h2 class="body__text-step" data-step="0">Hello, my name is Juweek Adolphe and I'm 24 years old. I live in Brooklyn, NY and I'm the most curious person I know.
                </h2>
                <h2 class="body__text-step" data-step="1">Sports, music, culture, politics; they all fascinate me and bring out my inner child. I'm currently a visual journalist for the Guardian, which means I experiment with visuals to better tell stories. Luckily, learning about things is part of my job.
                </h2>
                <h2 class="body__text-step" data-step="1">My two favorite things right now would have to be illustration and code. I love to draw, and I love to code, and recently I've been experimenting with the two. The better I become, though, the more I want to push the limit of what I can make.
                </h2>
                <h2 class="body__text-step" data-step="2">My project proposal is to create visual stories, focusing on mixing my illustration and other analog material with code. I'm already mixing the two at my job, but I want to take a more experimental approach to my work, as well as cover topics I'm more interested in. My contract ends in March, so this is the perfect time for me to take a new trajectory.</h2>
                <h2 class="body__text-step" data-step="4">Over 75% of the world's population are visual learners, and studies show we listen differently when we have the chance to explore. With a year to experiment, I can find new ways to merge media together in exciting ways. I can also shed new light on topics that many of us misunderstand.</h2>
                <h2 class="body__text-step" data-step="4">There are many directions I can take my work, from interactive to data-driven. Here are two projects I made, one an interactive piece about food, the other a data visualization about Congress.</h2>
                <h2 class="body__text-step" data-step="3">Personally, I have the goal of becoming a better illustrator. I'm relatively new to Illustrator, so I'll be sharing my journey of learning new techniques, such as using vector files, and drawing on the iPad. I'll also be doing a daily sketch challenge, engaging and encouraging the community to join me, while also improving my code art's quality.</h2>
                <h2 class="body__text-step" data-step="3">Speaking of community, sharing will be a large part of my process. I think the perspective of someone who is still learning can be appealing to professionals and beginners a like. A lot of my sketches will be uploaded to Instagram and Behance, along with my process. There are numerous sketching challenges (Inktober) that I can participate in as well, and in New York I can host various in-person meetups with the community. </h2>
                <h2 class="body__text-step" data-step="3">The timeline would be focused on getting good content. I'll go through experiences with my sketchbook, speak with experts like politicians, scientists, etc, and create my visual stories off of those experiences. There is a growing community between artists and coders, and I'll be traveling to these conferences and sharing my Adobe process.</h2>
                <h2 class="body__text-step" data-step="5">
                Since I was a young kid, I loved learning about the world through stories. Now I'm a stroyteller full-time, and I want to tell the best stories that I can.</h2>
                <h2 class="body__text-step" data-step="6">And here are examples of my illustration style. They are all stroke based, and have a little animation or two to make them really pop out.</h2>
